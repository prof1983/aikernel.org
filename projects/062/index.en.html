<h1>OpenCog</h1>

<p>No challenge today is more important than creating beneficial artificial general intelligence (AGI), with broad capabilities at the human level and ultimately beyond. OpenCog is an open-source software initiative aimed at directly confronting that challenge.</p>

<p>OpenCog is a project that aims to build an open source artificial intelligence framework. OpenCog Prime is a cognitive architecture with a specific set of interacting components designed to give rise to human-equivalent artificial general intelligence (AGI). OpenCog Prime's design is primarily the work of Ben Goertzel, but the OpenCog framework is intended as a generic framework for AGI research. OpenCog is released under the terms of the AGPL licence.</p>


<h2>OpenCog: A Software Framework for Integrative Artificial General Intelligence</h2>

<p>Abstract. The OpenCog software development framework, for advancement of the development and testing of powerful and responsible integrative AGI, is described. The OpenCog Framework (OCF) 1.0, to be released in 2008 under the GPLv2, is comprised of a collection of portable libraries for OpenCog applications, plus an initial collection of cognitive algorithms that operate within the OpenCog framework. The OCF libraries include a flexible knowledge representation embodied in a scalable knowledge store, a cognitive process scheduler, and a plug-in architecture for allowing interaction between cognitive, perceptual, and control algorithms.</p>

<h3>1. Introduction</h3>

<p>The information revolution we experience today is underpinned by numerous enabling technologies, many of which are based on open platforms and standards with conceptual roots dating back to the 1960s and earlier. Most of the present day Internet software infrastructure from Google, Amazon, Ebay and others, is built on Linux and other open source technologies.</p>

<p>The field of artificial intelligence has fallen woefully the rate of progress of other fields within computer science and information technology.
The reasons for this are many and varied, and exploring them all would take us too far off topic. However, we suggest that one viable path to remedying the situation involves providing the field of AI research with an open foundation comparable to the open foundations underlying popular Internet applications. In this paper we briefly describe the motivations and scientific approach underlying OpenCog.</p>

<p>OpenCog is designed with the ability to integrate different and varied AI methodologies within a common framework operating on a common knowledge representation and utilizing a common scheduler and I/O subsystem. Providing as much breadth and flexibility as is possible, consistently with the goal of providing a coherent unifying framework, has been an overriding design goal.</p>

<p>While OpenCog is a highly flexible platform, we recognize that software development generally proceeds most efficaciously in the context of concrete application goals. With this in mind our intention is to initially guide OpenCog development in the context of natural language conversation, both on the command line and potentially also in the context of embodied agents.</p>

<h3>2. The Challenges of Integrative AGI</h3>

<p>Precisely how the human brain works is unknown to scientists and laymen alike, but all of the available evidence suggests that the brain is a highly complex and integrative system [1]. Different parts of the brain carry out various functions, and no one part is particularly intelligent on its own, but working in concert within the right architecture they result in human-level intelligence. In this vein, Steven Mithen [2] has provided powerful albeit somewhat speculative vision of modern human intelligence as the integration of components that evolved relatively discretely in prehuman minds.</p>

<p>On the other hand, most of the work in the AI field today is far less integrative than what we see in the brain. AI researchers work on individual and isolated algorithms for learning, reasoning, memory, perception, etc. with few exceptions. The combination of algorithms into coordinated systems demonstrating synergistic intelligent behavior is much less frequent than it should be. The mainstream of AI research is attempting to address this, for instance the most recent AAAI conferences have contained a Special Track on Integrated Intelligence [3], and this trend is likely to continue. However, the move to more integrated intelligence approaches entails serious practical difficulties. Most AI researchers operate under extremely constrained resources, and performing system integration requires a large amount of extra work. The reasons for experimenting with AI algorithms in isolated rather than systemically integrated contexts is typically purely pragmatic rather than theoretical.</p>

<p>As a result, no one knows what level of intelligence could be achieved by taking an appropriate assemblage of cutting-edge AI algorithms and appropriately integrating them together in a unified framework, in which they can each contribute their respective strengths toward achieving the goals of an overall intelligent system. Of course, conceptual and architectural integration is required in addition to simple software integration, but conceptual and architectural integration is precisely what is needed as we move toward a practical understanding of how to create powerful AI systems. The current body of academic and commercial AI knowledge contains solutions to many of the key problems underlying the creation of powerful AI, but until these partial-solutions are integrated in useful ways, we cannot explore the synergistic effects which will emerge from their union, or discover the key gaps to be addressed by more fundamental research.</p>

<p>As discussed, one approach to overcoming this AI bottleneck and helping the research community transition to transition away from building algorithms and systems in isolation is to provide a flexible, powerful and approachable software framework, designed specifically for integration of AI algorithms. With this in mind, the authors and a number of colleagues have established the Open Cognition Project, beginning with the release of the OpenCog Framework, a software framework specifically intended to support the construction of integrative AI systems from component AI algorithms and structures.</p>

<p>The initial OpenCog Framework (OCF) codebase will consist largely of code donated by Novamente LLC [4], who will adapt much internal R&D to utilize OpenCog, and continue to make significant further code contributions to OpenCog over time. Although code flowing in both directions will undoubtedly benefit Novamente LLC, the authors believe that the greatest benefit OpenCog has to offer is energizing and boosting the global AI research community by significantly improving the tools at its disposal, tools which the community will have the freedom to utilize and modify to meet their diverse requirements.</p>

<p>Preliminary discussion of OpenCog has met with enthusiastic support from members of the academic, industry and open source communities, and has elicited sentiments that a project with OpenCog's goals and scope is long overdue but that its introduction must be carefully executed. Contingent upon funding for OpenCog proceeding as planned, we are targeting 1H08 for our first official code release, to be accompanied by a full complement of documentation, tools, and development support.</p>

<p>Подход сообщества OpenCog мне очень близок. И в частности то, что уже есть готовые сборки (практически AI OS) - это вселяет надежды.</p>
