<p>JADE (Java Agent DEvelopment Framework) is a software Framework fully implemented in Java language.
It simplifies the implementation of multi-agent systems through a middle-ware that complies with the
FIPA specifications and through a set of graphical tools that supports the debugging and deployment phases.
The agent platform can be distributed across machines (which not even need to share the same OS)
and the configuration can be controlled via a remote GUI.
The configuration can be even changed at run-time by moving agents from one machine to another one,
as and when required. JADE is completely implemented in Java language and the minimal system requirement is the version 1.4 of JAVA
(the run time environment or the JDK).</p>

<p>JADE (Java Agent DEvelopment Framework) is a software framework fully implemented in Java language.
It simplifies the implementation of multi-agent systems through a middle-ware that claims to comply with the
FIPA specifications and through a set of tools that supports the debugging and deployment phase.
The agent platform can be distributed across machines (which not even need to share the same OS)
and the configuration can be controlled via a remote GUI.
The configuration can be even changed at run-time by moving agents from one machine to another one, as and when required. JADE is completely implemented in Java language and the minimal system requirement is the version 1.2 of JAVA
(the run time environment or the JDK).</p>
--->

<p>The synergy between the JADE platform and the LEAP libraries allows to obtain a FIPA-compliant
agent platform with reduced footprint and compatibility with mobile Java environments down to J2ME-CLDC MIDP 1.0.
The LEAP libraries have been developed with the collaboration of the LEAP project and can be downloaded as an add-on of JADE from this same Web site.</p>

<p>JADE is free software and is distributed by Telecom Italia, the copyright holder,
in open source software under the terms of the LGPL ( Lesser General Public License Version 2).
Since May 2003, a JADE Board has been created that supervisions the management of the JADE Project.
Currently the JADE Board lists 5members: Telecom Italia , Motorola, Whitestein Technologies AG.,
Profactor GmbH, and France Telecom R&D.</p>

<!---
From this page you can now download JADE. 
We suggest to unzip the files by using the 'jar xvf' command rather than the winzip application because some incompatibilities have been reported in the past. 

Current version of JADE is 3.4.1 (17th November 2006). 

Note: All the binaries (lib/*.jar) have been generated by using the JDK1.4 compiler. 


File ~ File size Description of the content  
jadeAll.zip 8.9 MB This file contains all JADE, i.e. it is just composed of the 4 files below. If it is too large for downloading, the 4 files below might be downloaded instead.  
jadeBin.zip 1.6 MB This file contains JADE already compiled and ready to be used, i.e. a set of JAVA archive JAR files.  
jadeDoc.zip 5.5 MB This file contains all the JADE documentation included the Administrator's Guide and and the Programmer's Guide. NOTICE THAT all the documentation is also available on-line.  
jadeSrc.zip 1.8 MB This file contains all the JADE source code.  
jadeExamples.zip 270 KB This file contains the source code of the examples and a simple demo. All the examples and demo must be compiled.  


Since version 3.0b1, the LEAP add-on of JADE is also managed by the JADE team. This add-on, when combined with JADE, replaces some parts of the JADE kernel forming a modified runtime environment of JADE that can be deployed on a wide range of devices varying from servers to Java enabled cell phones (J2ME-CLDC-MIDP1.0). JADE already combined with the LEAP add-on can be downloaded from this page following the links below. Look at the LEAPUserGuide available in the On-line documentation page of this site for more details. 

File ~ File size Description of the content  
LEAP AddOn.zip 530 KB This file contains the source code and the examples of LEAP add-on.  
JadeLeapJ2se.zip 2.2 MB This file contains the version of JADE-LEAP (JADE combined with the LEAP add-on) to be executed on PCs and servers running jdk1.4 or later.  
JadeLeapPjava.zip 1.0 MB This file contains the version of JADE-LEAP (JADE combined with the LEAP add-on) to be executed on PDAs and smart phones running PersonalJava (or the J2ME-CDC-Personal Profile).  
JadeLeapMidp.zip 610 KB This file contains the version of JADE-LEAP (JADE combined with the LEAP add-on) to be executed on cell phones running J2ME-CLDC-MIDP1.0 or 2.0.

<h2>Jadex</h2>

<p><img src="jadex-screenshot.jpg"></p>

<p>Jadex is a Belief Desire Intention (BDI) reasoning engine that allows for programming intelligent software agents in XML and Java.
The resoning engine is very flexible and can be used on-top of different middleware infrastructures such as JADE.</p>

  <li><a href="http://jadex.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/bin/view/About/Overview">http://jadex.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/bin/view/About/Overview</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Mission Statement</h3>

<p>Intelligent agents are a modelling paradigm, based on the notion of agents with mental states.
The Jadex reasoning engine follows the Belief Desire Intention (BDI) model and facilitates easy
intelligent agent construction with sound software engineering foundations.
It allows for programming intelligent software agents in XML and Java and can be deployed on different kinds of middleware such as JADE.</p>

<p>To enable the creation of intelligent agents several different constituent parts have to be assembled.
It is necessary to provide an agent architecture that at least takes into account agent-internal,
agent society and artificial intelligence (AI) concepts.
It is a property of agent research that interesting research results in various isolated areas exist,
but that these results are not integrated into superordinated architectures.
Therefore until now no standards can address the construction of intelligent agents in all facets.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>The Jadex research project is conducted by the Distributed Systems and Information Systems Group at the University of Hamburg.
The developed software framework is available under GNUs LGPL license, and is continuously evolving.
The project's file releases are kindly hosted by the SourceForge.net portal.
The projects web presence is based on a wiki and thus allows Jadex users to contribute in various ways.
The reasoning engine has been put into practice in the context of several research, teaching,
and industrial application scenarios some of which are described here in the web.</p>
