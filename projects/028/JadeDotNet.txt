Agent Research Group - .net and JADE/LEAP

Where We Started

We (the Agent Research Group <index.html>) recently discovered that
Steffen  Rusitschka from Siemens (/Steffen.Rusitschka@mchp.siemens.de/
<mailto:(Steffen.Rusitschka@mchp.siemens.de>/) /had ported the LEAP
version of JADE to .NET.  We received the .bat file that would compile
JADE/LEAP into a .dll using Visual J#.  This works pretty well because
the pJava version of LEAP uses a version of Java that is 1.1.x.  This is
compatible with Visual J# and is thus would allow LEAP to be used as a
portability mechanism to bridge between the .NET world and the JADE
agent world.

Problems

The buildNET.bat file required that we place it in the top-level leap
directory and also place the vjs compiler on the PATH.  Having
accomplished this, we set about to build the system.  The first problem
was that vjs would not compile the whole system.  The errors that we
received were:

           
src\icp\jicp\share\jade\imtp\leap\JICP\JICPMServer.java(256,11): error
VJS1363: Cannot access class 'jade.imtp.leap.LEAPSerializationException'

           
src\icp\jicp\j2se\jade\imtp\leap\JICP\JICPServer.java(205,13): error
VJS1363: Cannot access class 'jade.imtp.leap.LEAPSerializationException'

After some rooting around we found that the compiler was complaining
because LEAPSerializationException was not visible.  The solution was to
make the class public.  So, we simply added public before the class
definition on line 49 of the file
(src\imtp\leap\jade\imtp\leap\LEAPSerializationException.java).  This
allowed the file to properly compile.  The second part of the .bat file
was to copy the vjslib.dll file to the lib directory.  Since we are not
using the .net SDK, but instead are using Visual Studio, this caused an
error and we ignored it.  Note - as with pjava, there are two files that
will not compile under Visual J#.  The .bat file renames them before
doing the compilation and then renames them back when finished. 

Visual Studio Project for the Jade .dll

To make this process a bit more Visual Studio friendly, we created a VS
solution which will build the dll file.  The .bat file works by using
the /recurse compiler command line argument which will recursively
compile all of the files in a directory.  We made the solution work the
same way.  The one problem is that we have yet to figure a way to
exclude the 2 files that won't compile.  So, what we have done is to
rename by hand before compiling the system.  [NOTE - one idea is to
explicitly import those directories ourselves and exclude them, then
removing the directory from the /recurse.  Unfortunately that is a LOT
of files.  Another solution is to see why they won't compile and see if
we can fix them.]

How to Start Jade

So, the next problem was how to start the system.  Normally we would say
java jade.Boot ...  There might be a better solution, but what we did
was to create a project (runJadeLeapDotNet) that simply had the
Boot.java file as its only file.  We added references to the
jadeleapdotnet.dll file (and later on, for every agent that we call, we
had to add a reference so it could find the associated .dll file). 
Anyway, we set this as the startup project to run when executing the
system, did a build, and viola the system started up.  Leap uses a 
property file to specify command line arguments (this defaults to
leap.properties), so we stored in the default file, which agents to
start and the location of the main container.

VJ# Sample Agent

We then undertook the task of writing some agents using the DLL and then
testing the system.  The intent was to write a simple agent that would
"ping" one of the agentcities agents (in particular, our own SLC
agentcities site).  The first problem with this model was that this
version did not support the HTTP mtp protocol.  We spent some time
trying to get it to compile, but gave up. Mostly this was because the
JADE add-on for HTTP requires a sax parser and we couldn't find one with
the same interface (it probably exists within Windows, but we couldn't
find it).  A second solution was to run a J2SE version of JADE/LEAP as a
main container and have it include the http MTP.  We did this.  However,
our local VJ# agent could not connect with the main container.  After
some debugging, we discovered that the
jade.imtp.leap.FullCommandDispatcher was failing in send function.  It
could not find the jicp transport in the HashTable.  It tried to look
into the HashTable using the string jicp and that was not found.  It
turns out that earlier in the file, in the addicp function (around line
146) it stores the string jicp which has been turned into a class which
is CaseInsensitiveString.  For some reason, the HashTable would not
properly call the equals function if the object that it was comparing
was different than the object that is being placed into the table.  We
could not determine if this was because HashTable is not working
properly or CaseInsensitiveString was not working properly or what.  Our
solution was to change the icps.get call (around line 310) to turn its
string argument into a CaseInsensitiveString.  After this change, we
were able to fire up our .NET agent system as a container and connect to
a separate main container.  The VJ# agent then successfully ran,
including sending a ping to a remote (using HTTP-MTP) and received the
alive message.  Note - one little trick, we had to add the
JadeLeapDotNet.dll as a referenced object for the project

VC# Sample Agent

Being on a roll, we decided to create another agent identical to the VJ#
version that was written in C#.  Having never coded in C# this was a bit
of a learning experience, but we got it working in pretty short order. 
The only thing that we couldn't figure out how to do was to create an
anonymous embedded class (in VJ# we did: addBehaviour(new
CyclicBehaviour () { ... but we couldn't figure out how to do the same
thing in VC#).  We ended up creating a behaviour as a separate class
(but still embedded within the sample agent file).  Again, once we got
it to compile, it worked flawlessly.  Note - as with VJ#, we had to add
a reference to the Jade dll and we also had to add a reference to the
VJ# support dll (vjslib.dll).

VC++ Sample Agent

So, at this point, we decided, why not create a VC++ agent as well. 
Then we could use our solutions as a guideline for others who might want
to write agents in several different languages.  We were experts in C++,
but had not yet written in managed C++.  We started by doing a new
project, choosing VC++ managed class library.  The first problem was how
to link in the various libraries.  This was solved when we learned about
the #using directive.  With #using, you can specify .dll's that you wish
to link into your program.  You may provide a full path, or just a name
and put the full path with the /AI command option.  The location to find
the #using libraries is specified under the C++ project properties under
C/C++->General->Resolve #using references.  Simply click on the ... and
fill in each location of where you can find the files.  The project for
this has hardwired paths for our machine, so you will have to edit this
for the proper location of your files.  Another thing that we found
different was the use of :: instead of . for walking the package
hierarchy.  They have basically mapped packages into namespaces.  Again,
the code is almost identical to the other versions.  One problem that we
initially had was to utilize 'cout' for printing messages.  This caused
a type problem because the strings were "managed by the gc" and not the
same as strings used in unmanaged C++.  So, instead of using cout, we
simply used the Console.writeLine command and all is happy.

Links to Useful Files

If you wish to utilize this code and start to write agents in the .NET
framework, here are some files that will help you.  We will work with
the JADE/LEAP folks to get our code changes into the next release of
LEAP to make the process totally painless.  Until then, you can use the
following files to help get you started:

    *

      LEAPSerializationException.java
      <JADEDotNet/LEAPSerializationException.java> - the version with
      the public class specification to allow the .dll to compile.

    *

      buildNET.bat <JADEDotNet/buildNET.bat> - the original batch file
      for creating the JADE/Leap dll.  Don't forget to put the vjs
      command on your path and to store this file in your leap top-level
      directory (with the other build files).  You will notice at the
      top of the batch file it says to do a build with merge and
      unmerge, please do this.

    *

      JadeLeapDotNet.dll <JADEDotNet/JadeLeapDotNet.dll> - the compiled
      dll file (so you don't have to buld it if you don't want to). 
      Note, this is using the 2.1 version of Leap.

    *

      FullCommandDispatcher.java <JADEDotNet/FullCommandDispatcher.java>
      - the fixed extraction of the mtp from the HashTable.

    *

      leapnet.zip <JADEDotNet/leapnet.zip> - all of the Visual Studio
      files for the sample agents and building the jade dll file.  Note
      - leapnet.sln is the solution that includes the running jade code
      and in the JadeLeapDotNet.sln file is the Vis Studio solution for
      building the .dll file.  The solutions are set up to generate the
      various code files into the leapnet\lib directory.  If you decide
      to do a "start" in the leapnet solution, you need to go and edit
      the leap.properties file to adhere to your current situation.  The
      one that it reads by default is in the
      leapnet\RunJadeBootDotNet\bin\Debug directory.

    *

      runmain.bat <JADEDotNet/runmain.bat> which will start up a Jade
      running the main container so you can make the .NET agents connect
      with the main (it allows you to have a gui, sniffer, etc. running
      in the main).

    *

      http.jar <JADEDotNet/http.jar> and crimson.jar
      <JADEDotNet/crimson.jar> - used so you can have http access (built
      from the jade add-on)

How to Get Started

   1.

      Get Jade and Leap

   2.

      Connect to the leap directory and build the j2se version (you can
      use this so you can run a main container with more stuff - like
      the RMA and http mtp - buildLEAP.bat

   3.

      Copy the new version of LEAPSerializeionException.java to its
      location - src\imtp\leap\jade\imtp\leap

   4.

      Copy the new version of FullCommandDispatcher.java to the same
      directory

   5.

      If you want to use the batch file, then find vjs's location and
      put it on your PATH; run buildNET.bat (ignoring the errors about
      vjslib.dll)

   6.

      If you want to use the Visual Studio version, then first rename
      the two files
      src\kernel\standard\jade\core\RealNotificationManager.java and
      src\kernel\standard\jade\core\FullResourceManager.java to
      something without a .java on the end; fire up Visual Studio and
      load the JadeLeapDotNet.sln solution file; then do a build

   7.

      Note - the batch file currently puts the .dll into the top-level
      .lib directory, while all of the Visual Studio programs put their
      files into the leapnet\lib directory.

   8.

      Copy http.jar and crimson.jar to whichever .lib directory you
      chose above and edit the runmain.bat (in the leapnet top-level
      directory) file to point to the appropriate location for these files

   9.

      Edit the leap.properties file (again in the leapnet top-level
      directory) with the appropriate values (like the hostname and
      whatever else you want). Start the main container - runmain.bat

  10.

      Run visual studio and load in the leapnet.sln solution file.  Edit
      the leap.properties file in the
      leapnet\RunJadeBootDotNet\bin\Debug to have your values, then do a
      build solution and finally start the debugger.  This should fire
      up the various agents and each one will send a ping to a site.

FIX - ToString in aclmessage should be toString.
